## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/bodhiapps/chat/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email**
   - Send an email to: [security@bodhisearch.org] (replace with actual email)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include

- **Description**: Brief description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What kind of vulnerability is it? What can an attacker do?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Version**: Which version(s) are affected?
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include code or screenshots
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix it

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Updates**: We will keep you informed about the progress
- **Fix Timeline**: We aim to release a fix within 90 days for critical issues
- **Credit**: We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
